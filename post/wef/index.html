                <p>Microalgae are getting more and more attention in the field of the method of carbon sink because of their many advantages, but this technique still has some limitations and can further develop in many aspects.</p>
<p>The first problem is about the selection and cultivation of microalgae. Chlorella is one of the typical examples. Almost all natural Chlorella’s specific growth rate and degree of inhibition are various with a single concentration of CO2. And none of those natural microalgae are perfect to be the resource for carbon sink. Thus, further developing gene technology is important for the world in the future, such as the cell fusion method, the breeding techniques for cross breeding, and the gene marksmanship. For example, transcription regulators were cloned from Pseudomonas bacteria and transferred to cyanobacteria, where NA+ tolerance increased from 2.5% to 4.5%. By using those methods, the excellent advantages of different microalgae can be integrated into the same special microalgae, thus not only perfecting the microalgae bank, but also improving the carbon sequestration efficiency and reducing side effects.</p>
<p>The second problem is the efficiency of the Photobioreactor. Nowadays, it is difficult to increase the photosynthetic efficiency in the dense microalgae and since the algae’s requirements on light and temperature are too high, reactors with efficient control over these environmental factors need to be developed. Among many reactors, the most promising one is an airlift reactor structure, which is a multi-phase flow reactor structure developed from a bubble reactor. When the air and CO2 are mixed, they first enter the gas distributor and then distribute into the reactor, thus forming uniform and small bubbles and increasing the gas acceptance area, which can effectively improve the mass transfer efficiency of CO2, algal liquid and gas-liquid. Compared with the biological storage of the racetrack pool reactor and the horizontal tubular reactor, that of the airlift reactor decreases by nearly 25 times.</p>
<p>The third problem is its energy efficiency calculation, the establishment of a sound system to achieve large-scale factory production. The development of the following three aspects is the key to achieve high efficiency CO2 fixation and large-scale industrialization of microalgae in the future: the surface area of photobioreactor, the gas-liquid mass transfer efficiency and the light source design. Different photobioreactors have different characteristics at present. Open bioreactors are called economical and suitable for large scale construction systems. The efficiency of co2 fixation in closed reactors is high. Combining different reactors’ advantages, the application of efficient carbon sequestration technology in large-scale microalgal light reactor is the future research direction. And improving the attachment structure makes the bubbles more compact and unified, and increasing the residence time of bubbles in algal liquid can improve the CO2 fixation efficiency of microalgae. Considering the future environmental, social and economic benefits, it would be more meaningful for universities to develop photobioreactors for solar energy collection devices.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, although CO2 fixation of microalgae has important social and environmental benefits, there are still many technical problems to be overcome, and the application scope of microalgae is becoming larger and wider. In the future, if we can solve the problems of high-quality microalgae cultivation, research and development of efficient photobioreactors, and energy efficiency calculation, and establish a perfect system to realize large-scale factory production, we may also provide a new, economical and effective carbon sequestration model for solving energy, health, environmental and other problems.</p>

<p>This trip was very complex since I would go there for a text. However, due to the covid-19, I couldn't go into the text center because I didn't have the RNA detection paper. It's really a bad new.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was still glad to go there for nearly a week. As a people who live in northeast city all year around, spending time in a south city was a pretty good experience!</p>
<p>Xuzhou is famous for its Yunlong Lake. It is a very big lake with so many beautiful lotus. Many residents enjoy drinking tea and chatting by the lake, and there are also many old people practicing Tai Chi by the lake. The lake creates a very quiet atmosphere. Walking along the lake and looking into the distance, everything seems to slow down. Even though there is a downtown surrounded by tall buildings, the lake brings a long-term silence far beyond the noise of the honking horns in the downtown. Maybe this is the charm of nature</p>

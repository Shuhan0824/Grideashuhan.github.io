                <p>Packaging in a circular economy<br>
The linear packaging industry<br>
Packaging: Benefits and Challenges<br>
Challenges: when it becomes a litter or even in the plastic soup.<br>
The value of the empty packaging is maybe less than a cent.<br>
Cleaning up is a large negative cost.<br>
More expensive to clean up the ocean.<br>
Benefits: protect the product, keep food fresh, save food waste, give you information about the product and seduce consumers to buy it.<br>
Designers should not only think about the design, but also the whole cycle.<br>
We should design a product that lasts longer, or maybe you don’t need disposables.<br>
linear model (of take, make, use and dispose) is destroying the material value embedded in (waste) packaging.</p>
<p>Benefits of Packaging in Detail<br>
Product protection, utility and communication.</p>
<p>Challenges for Plastic Packaging<br>
A large amount of our packaging waste consists of plastics.<br>
1.Plastics waste generation is growing rapidly, negatively affecting the environment and human health.<br>
2.Recovering plastic waste represents a substantial economic opportunity.<br>
3.Currently only a limited amount of global plastics waste (most of it packaging) is recovered.</p>
<p>A circular perspective for packaging<br>
Packaging and the Circular Economy<br>
Packaging is considered a Fast Moving Consumer Good (FMCG). These are products that are designed to have a short lifespan and are constantly in rotation.<br>
Products are consumed in large quantities.<br>
Strategies:<br>
The first design strategy: rethink : reimagining the design or application of the packaging (or product) in order to maximise positive (and minimise negative) environmental and societal impacts.<br>
Why are we doing this?<br>
Why do we use this packaging?<br>
Why are we using disposables?<br>
The second one: reuse: collecting, cleaning and reusing packaging items for the same purpose.<br>
We have to organize a system to do that.(combination systems)<br>
The third one: recycling: converting waste packaging into materials for new packaging items.<br>
The last one: renew: using renewable and/or biodegradable materials in packaging.<br>
Recycle again or make it biodegradable.</p>
<p>The Packaging Lifecycle<br>
linear economy: resources make a one-way trip from raw material through the production and use phases to become waste.</p>
<p>Developing Circular Product-Packaging Combinations<br>
Whenever a product depends on its packaging in order to be used they are considered a Product-Packaging Combination (PPC).<br>
Developing Product-Packaging Combinations (PPCs):<br>
1.Integrate the development of the product and its packaging.( Develop the packaging while you are designing the product.)<br>
2.Consider sustainability aspects at the beginning of a new PPC development process.<br>
3.Involve all stakeholders that are part of the PPC’s value chain.<br>
Case study: lush<br>
A Vision for Packaging Free Cosmetics<br>
First: the main challenges for designing naked products<br>
Some thing should be think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>this ingredient is working for the consumer and this is a really beautiful effective product.</li>
<li>they gets to the shop in good condition(make sure that the transportation packaging is fit for this purpose.)</li>
<li>it is recycled and can be recycled at the end of the life.<br>
4.Making packaging free cosmetics requires the company to adjust the design and composition of the product.<br>
5.The regular functions of packaging still need to be considered: safe transportation, supply of product information, storage at home.<br>
6.The design of sustainable packaging starts by thinking about the sourcing of the materials and taking the end-of-life of the packaging into account.<br>
Recyclable Packaging<br>
Second: in-house recycling of plastic packaging<br>
Recycling issues : 1. people not really recognizing what recyclable plastic and not.<br>
2.make sure they return fast enough.<br>
Benefit: 1. We have been able to learn how to recycle better with less energy input and use of raw materials resourses.<br>
2.this system doesn’t use heat and chemicals.<br>
Disadvantage: an awful lot<br>
Lush improved the recyclability of their packaging by using just one material.<br>
Using recycled material requires adjustments in the production process, but it can be reused to make packaging again.<br>
Renewables &amp; Reusables<br>
Renewable materials are used in the company's packaging, but only in limited quantities.<br>
Issues around the sourcing and end-of-life of bioplastics currently restricts the use of these materials at Lush.<br>
Making packaging reusable is an important step to design out packaging waste.</li>

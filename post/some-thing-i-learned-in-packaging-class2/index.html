                <p>Recycling of packaging<br>
Recycling as a circular strategy<br>
Recycling as a Circular Strategy<br>
focus on the recycling of plastics.<br>
Recycling is a process in which products are broken down into fragments to reclaim the materials they consist of; these materials can then be reused in other products.<br>
This does mean that extra energy is required in both the destruction of the old product and the production of the new product.<br>
The packaging recycling process<br>
While different materials commonly used in packaging , a generic recycling process always consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Waste packaging collection.</li>
<li>(Manual or automated) separation of different materials and/ or sorting by type.</li>
<li>Reprocessing waste packaging into new raw materials.</li>
<li>Applying recycled materials to manufacture new packaging.<br>
Design for Recyclability<br>
two important considerations:</li>
<li>Optimise the use of materials to facilitate the recycling process<br>
basic ‘design rules’<br>
Prioritise the functionality of the packaging.<br>
Avoid toxins.<br>
Use one single material when possible.<br>
If multiple materials must be used, make sure that they are easily separable.<br>
Communicate the material composition and end-of-life options.</li>
<li>Take a system perspective on recycling<br>
Apply recycled materials whenever possible. This will help create further demand for recycled materials, which will, in turn, improve the economic viability of recycling efforts.<br>
Pay attention to the efficiency of forward and reverse logistics.<br>
Innovations in plastic packaging recycling<br>
Introduction to plastic recycling<br>
the waste is collected at a regional location. Big pieces of waste that don’t belong there are taken out.<br>
Recycling Plastic Packaging<br>
Packaging accounts for about 40% of all the plastics we use globally.<br>
In Europe, current plastic recycling is primarily focused on waste management rather than value recovery.<br>
The after use quality of waste plastic packaging makes it difficult to restore it to ‘virgin’ level quality. Additives can also cause problems for recycling.<br>
Types of Plastic Recycling<br>
processes for plastics recycling can be divided into two categories<br>
Mechanical Recycling<br>
Mechanical recycling usually consists of a size reduction (i.e. shredding or pulverising) of the plastics waste.( Compounding)<br>
Chemical Recycling<br>
Chemical recycling involves chemically returning plastic waste to monomers in order to create new polymers. Their properties are equal to virgin plastics, but the required energy input is higher than for mechanically recycled plastics. In most cases, chemical recycling is not (yet) commercially viable.<br>
Demand Driven Innovation<br>
Polymer manufacturers have little interest in making the ‘perfect’ polymer<br>
brands have started exploring the possibility of recycling their own plastics. This, in turn, puts pressure on polymer manufacturers to produce plastics that are easily recyclable.<br>
Plastics are manufactured in hundreds of different colours, which can complicate the recycling process. New sorting technologies may provide a solution to this problem.<br>
If a recycled material is pure enough it requires little or no extra processing to use it in new products.<br>
Sorting Plastic Waste in Detail<br>
key technologies that are used to separate plastic scrap:<br>
Sink-Float Density Separation<br>
The plastics are separated based on their density relative to that of the fluid that they are in.<br>
X-Ray Technology<br>
X-rays are used to distinguish between different types of polymers according to their density.<br>
Near Infrared Spectroscopy<br>
A NIR sensor can distinguish materials based on how they reflect light. An air jet is used to blow materials into separate streams. NIR Spectroscopy is less suitable for dark coloured plastics since these absorb nearly all light.<br>
Future Recycling Technologies<br>
a density gradient :Different types of polymers will float at a different height within that liquid and can therefore be sorted in a single process.<br>
Apply micro robots to manipulate plastic flakes in space.<br>
An important limitation is that the equipment required for these new technologies still needs to be developed.</li>

Introduction to Infectious Disease<br>
Infectious diseases have greatest impact on children, the elderly, and the pregnant women.<br>
Vector-borne Disease<br>
The Basics of Vector-borne Disease<br>
Rainfall can substantially influence risk of vector-borne disease<br>
rainfall is associated with dengue outbreaks. Rain creates pools of water that can be breeding habitat for juvenile mosquitos.<br>
droughts may also promote vector-borne disease outbreaks.<br>
Waterborne Disease<br>
warming temperatures and more intense precipitation may favor waterborne disease outbreaks.<br>
rainfall washes pathogens contained in animal and human excrement into sewer systems and eventually into local water bodies where water may be drawn from for drinking or crop irrigation. Warmer temperatures may promote growth of pathogens.<br>
Cities and Sewers<br>
Some cities have drain pipes that carry stormwater run-off and sewage together.<br>
the sewer systems have outfall pipes that drain into local waterbodies to prevent sewage backing up into peoples' homes and onto streets.<br>
Research on cities and regions in the United States with combined sewers may be more likely to have E. coli contaminated water  and higher rates of emergency room visits External link after extreme rainfall events.<br>
Even cities with combined sewer system have been able to substantially reduce discharges of untreated sewage through a variety of actions.<br>
Harmful Algal and Cyanobacteria Blooms<br>
Causes of Algal and Cyanobacterial Blooms<br>
they can also produce toxins that are dangerous to wildlife and swimmers.<br>
Warmer ocean temperatures and heavier precipitation, which increases the delivery of nutrients, can promote the growth of algae and cyanobacteria.<br>
One of the key ingredients for a harmful algal bloom is nitrogen.(nitrogen based fertilizer)<br>
This scenario occurs wherever agriculture and rivers co-exist<br>
Health Effects of Harmful Algal Blooms<br>
Algal and cyanobacterial toxins cause a range of illness in humans and wildlife<br>
Eg: headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, and numbness or tingling.<br>
Algal Bloom Trends<br>
ocean acidification may promote even more abundant and toxic algal blooms<br>
Overview of Malaria</p>
<p>Malaria's Impact<br>
mostly in lowland tropical areas<br>
Almost half of the Earth's population currently live in areas where malaria can be transmitted.<br>
The incidence of malaria has been declining in many parts of the world, especially in Africa.<br>
Linear or nonlinear relationship.<br>
In a linear relationship, increasing one item always increases or decreases another at the same rate.<br>
Increasing one factor may increase or decrease a connected factor, depending on the situation.<br>
nonlinear approaches are necessary to understand infectious diseases in a changing climate.(reason: ecological systems are complex and they involve lots of interactions, which often end up being nonlinear because they involve things like desity dependence, competition that have some optimum that might turn over over time).<br>
The mosquito life style.<br>
The reproduction of malarial parasites involves stages in mosquitoes and in humans<br>
the mosquitoes lay their eggs in water.<br>
The time the parasite spends developing in the mosquitois known as the extrinsic incubation period.<br>
Temperature<br>
Mosquitos and temperature<br>
Warmer temperatures accelerate development until temperatures are high enough to be lethal. Colder temperatures slow development until development stops because it's too cold.( they are cold-blooded and cannot survive when temperatures get too hot or too cold.)<br>
Warmer temperatures promote higher biting rates and faster parasite development.<br>
high temperatures also increase mosquito mortality.<br>
Development<br>
Temperature and Development<br>
the same amount of temperature variability does not affect all mosquito vectors equally.<br>
Altitude<br>
Temperature and Altitude<br>
climate warms, it may facilitate the spread of malaria to higher elevations, which were historically too cool for the disease to gain a foothold.<br>
Many cities in mountainous regions in the tropics were established at altitudes high enough to make them safe from mosquitoes and the diseases they carry.<br>
High temperature doesn’t mean the is not malaria transmission.<br>
Humidity declining, transmission declining.<br>
Precipitation<br>
Malaria and Precipitation<br>
The mosquitoes that transmit malaria prefer standing pools of water to breed in.<br>
Saturated ground might be prone to flooding whereas dry compact earth could be perfect for development of small pools.<br>
Too much rain can ruin the pool.<br>
The complexity of infectious disease<br>
The Interplay of Natural Systems<br>
using models can and will yield valuable insights that may inform decisions about how best to manage climate-related disease emergence.<br>
Human Intervention<br>
We can reduce our vulnerability to insect bites via insecticide and bed netting, reduce our vulnerability to infection through nutrition and medicine, and control how much we come in contact with others.<br>
vast areas of the world had wetlands drained , which deprived mosquitoes of habitat. For another, widespread use of insecticides and antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine and its derivatives, have curtailed the prevalence of the mosquito vectors and parasites.<br>
Aedes Mosquitoes<br>
Case study: Aedes mosquitoes<br>
these mosquitoes bred in natural pools of water, such as treeholes, but with urbanization, they have adapted to breeding in used tires and water containers.<br>
Their ability to thrive in cities raises concerns for increased disease spread with the growth of cities,<br>
The water and sanitation or trash services are two of the most important components for high desities.<br>
They seem to blossom in these dense urban environments.（lots of people）<br>
From Global to Local Disease Forecasts<br>
Steps Forward<br>
The problem about making local prediction is that in any local environment, there so many different variables that zre changing.<br>
Marrying climate forecasts with infectious disease models provides another complication when it comes to predicting what climate change will mean for infectious disease in the future.<br>
Multiple Solutions<br>
At local scale, climate might not be one of the major drivers of changes in transmission.<br>
See longer transmission seasons.</p>

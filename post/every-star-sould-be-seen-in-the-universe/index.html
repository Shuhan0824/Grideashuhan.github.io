                <p>Because of the COVID-19, I had to do my volunteer work online. Both my students and I have to use computers to connect to our classes, and my students should hand in their homework in their Wechat. Although it is not as convenient as field trips, I also discover many things behind education mechanism.</p>
<p>When I was talking, playing with my students, I found that school has becoming a happy experience for them and they freely regarded me as a friend.  And I am glad that the local primary school helps them to study and to learn important life skills which will set them up in the future. That means our society has begun to value and improved the shortage of educational resources.</p>
<p>However, I also found that they have many deficiencies compared with others, both in study and daily life: The students I taught is in grade five, usually they should be able to read ,to write, and to think for themselves, but they just know how to keep living and they only recognized a little professional knowledge. I am sad to see that situation. Every child have their own talents which should be discovered and developed by education, however, the massive unequal education blocks their original unique light, which is crucial to the development of our society.</p>
<p>I pondered over the phenomenon for a long time, even once questioned why there were so many innocent inequalities in such a resource-rich world, why so many stars, which have the same power we have, can't shine amazing, can't be seen in this plant.</p>
<p>I found the answer in ourselves. Most of us are lucky to born and grow up in a relatively prosperous family. Thus, in our perception, inequality is a normal phenomenon that is nearly impossible to deal with, and we even don't see it as a problem. The neglecting is the root cause of the problem in the long run, I think. In addition, unlike improvising a project, educating children is a job that requires constant input, and the goal of it is in many aspects, like the ability to think, ability to understand and the ability to conduct oneself, which is hard for investors to see results, especially for volunteers who provide short-term support services. The mainly education in the poorest area is severed by volunteers, however, I found most of them do this task to improve their individual performance. So teaching student is just a task for them, finishing their class means their duty has been done. In fact, education goes far beyond that, there is still a lot of space needs them to fill in. Wave after wave of volunteers come here to get the job done, to exploit poverty and inequality to create opportunities for themselves, to devour the light that children should shine for them. That's why the local government don't prefer to funding more on education; That's why many kind people refuse to contribute; That' why we know the problem is always there but it can't be improved much.</p>
<p>People who don't do it because they can't get immediate results, chose to neglect because it seems not relative to themselves, give up it because the audience is relatively small, but are forced to do it because of the trend of egoism, will only be ignored and finally swallowed up by the refined egoism society in the end.</p>
<p>I once heard a man said, we are all common people who take three meals everyday, who sleep many hours at night, but only if we can do something benefit to our society sincerely from our heart, we are really great ones. Most of us is just a ordinary being, we don't have a strong appeal to call every people contribute in children education without egoism, but we can let yourself be fully engaged. Maybe we just teach one child now, but there is a family behind the children, and the nation is composed of many families, and the world is built by nations. Every little effort and progress adds a tiny but crucial stake to the final outcome.</p>
<p>After all, our world will be children's, and every child will take their biggest effort to light up everywhere.</p>
<p>Every star should be seen in the universe, and I hope to be a compost of their cosmos.</p>

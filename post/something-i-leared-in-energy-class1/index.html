                <p>Energy overview<br>
Introduction and the units of energy<br>
Useful definition:<br>
Primary energy (J) -------- Final energy (j) : efficiency(&lt;=1)<br>
Useful energy (j): finally used to provide some good or service.<br>
Energy service: 1.goods and service people actually wants, energy is one of necessary ingredients.<br>
2. No efficiency (its unit is not j)<br>
Normal vessels can’t calculate efficiency directly.<br>
Convert energy price:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unit: dollars per gigajoule</li>
<li>The capital cost of devices that convert transform energy: dollars per kilowatt of capacity</li>
<li>Cents per kilowatt hour = dollars per gigajoule</li>
<li>The conversion between units in which energy commodities per commonly sold and some standard unit is not a simple unit conversion. Reason: different fuels have different heating values.</li>
<li>The rate of energy use is watt –a joule per second<br>
Energy flows in quantity per year<br>
Compare energy flow: either watts or joules<br>
Follow the Sankey<br>
Sankey diagram</li>
<li>electricity is an energy carrier.<br>
Only 6%of electricity is lost in transmission and distribution losses.<br>
Only a little more than a third of that heat gets turned into electricity.\</li>
<li>Renewable: count a gigajoule of electricity supplied by one of these direct electricity renewable as equal to one gigajoule of primary energy.</li>
<li>The generation of directly electricity sources is 1/3 of that of hydropower.</li>
<li>There is ambiguous to calculate the wasted energy.<br>
Energy use today<br>
1.residential: space heating is the most<br>
Clothes washer is the least and all of its use is directly electricity.<br>
2.Industrial:be dominated by two interrelated big ones :production of chemicals and petroleum products<br>
3.Transportation: cars are just a little bit more than half of a total transportation energy use.<br>
Heavy freight modes are about 1/3 of total energy use.<br>
Pipeline is involved in transportation sector.<br>
4.building, commercial and residential: the total energy use for residential buildings is larger than commercial buildings.<br>
The energy of heating in residential building is larger than commercial building (commercial building is dominated by the heat comes from people and other equipment inside)<br>
The energy use for electronics is small either in commercial or residential.<br>
Blizzard of complexity: 1.all coal goes to electricity.<br>
2.transportation only uses petroleum fuels.<br>
3. natural gas goes more or less everywhere.<br>
Energy use across the world<br>
Patterns of energy use vary across regions of the world.</li>
<li>China: almost coal. Only 1/3 coal is used in industry</li>
<li>biofuel dominated , oil-fired electricity, but a small amount of it are very commoN for many other poor countries in Africa.</li>
</ol>
<p>The movement of energy(oil):1. A very large flow out of the middle east to everywhere, especially Asia.<br>
2. the large flow out of Russia, especially to western Europe.<br>
Global trade: gas moves in two different ways: 1. Pipelines: the very large total exports by pipeline from Russia/middle east<br>
2. ships: carry liquefied natural gas.<br>
International trade in electricity is tiny.<br>
Oil is the largest internationally traded commodity.<br>
The History of our Energy System<br>
energy<br>
Energy use grew before 1850(with population grow)<br>
After 1850, things changed dramatically: access to fossil fuels increased energy consumption, that allowed more people to be supported on the same amount of land.<br>
This dirve the pace of technological and social innovation<br>
We keep using more of every fuel.<br>
US and Europe are close to flat about total primary energy use and their consumption has hardly varied.<br>
There is a slight declines in the EU and US.<br>
China has uses more energy<br>
Per capita energy comsuption is so much higher in US than it is in Europe is because US consume more energy- intensive goods and services. And US is more inefficient.<br>
Electricity<br>
There is a steady increase in the fraction of energy that uses electricity overtime.<br>
Driver: the ease of use of electricity.<br>
Coal and water power, hydro, have been the most stable overtime.<br>
Gas have risen<br>
Carbon free electricity generating sources: 1. A decline in nuclear power<br>
2. Solar and wind are still small but grow fast.<br>
Nonfossil sources:  1. Fossil fuels still account for almost80% of final energy consumption.<br>
How the structure of an energy’s energy use changes over time as economies mature.<br>
This is a shift in economy form manufacturing to services, because the amount used for manufacturing has steadily declined.<br>
Space heating has declined over time<br>
The amazing fast transition is from gas to electricity.<br>
Energy transition is driven by the value to the end user, the quality of the light, and the cost.<br>
Energy prices<br>
Commodity Nature of Energy<br>
Energy as a Commodity<br>
Energy has a well-defined local market price, with little differentiation between brands or suppliers.<br>
Oil has one global price.(easy to transport)<br>
Natural and electricity’s price vary more between regions(hard to transport.)<br>
Energy price<br>
The price of electricity is much higher than the price of gas or coal.<br>
Reason: 1. It is inefficient to turn coal and gas into electricity(efficiency is 1/3),<br>
2. coal is the cheapest energy sources but it is very expensive to use.<br>
We use very little oil for heating now because oil costs have been consistently higher than gas costs.<br>
The reason for people pay a lot more for oil than gas:<br>

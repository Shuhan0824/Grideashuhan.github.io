                <p>Heat and Air Quality<br>
Heat related diseases<br>
Heat stroke and heat exhaustion will become much more common<br>
Increase the risk of heart failure and diabetes and the repercussion for the elderly and obsess.<br>
Not All Heat is Created Equal<br>
Heat index<br>
a cooler temperature with higher humidity can produce conditions more hazardous to health.<br>
Cooling down<br>
How human bodies deal with heat<br>
Our bodies are able to lose heat in four ways:<br>
1.Conduction involves losing heat through contact with something colder than our bodies.<br>
2.Radiation: gets hot out, our blood vessels dilate and allowing greater radiation of heat from our bodies into the air and helps cool us down.<br>
3. convection :eg: you turn on a fan that blows across your skin on a hot day and you feel cool. Cooling by convection only works well if the air outside your body is cooler than your body.<br>
4.evaporation. the temperature outside is over normal body temperature<br>
if there is a lot of water in the air, sweating is less effective, that’s why the hot moist air is more dangerous.<br>
Wet Bulb Temperature<br>
The temperature a wet bulb thermometer measures is usually lower than the temperature a dry bulb thermometer measures.<br>
Because the bulb is wet, it can lose heat through evaporation (just like our bodies). If the wet bulb temperature is the same as the dry bulb temperature it means that the air is so saturated with water<br>
Heat and Health<br>
Heat can promote dehydration which makes a wide range of diseases worse<br>
Extreme heat and humidity can cause diseases such as heat stroke<br>
The ability to dissipate heat: pubertal children&gt;old people<br>
Heat waves in the near future<br>
Climate models have been used to predict what the global average temperature will be throughout this century.<br>
climate change will increase the areas on the earth that experience lethal heatwaves<br>
as the average temperature goes up, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves grows dramatically.<br>
Ozone<br>
Ground-level ozone<br>
Inhaling ozone is bad for our lungs.<br>
Ozone is formed when byproducts of fossil fuel combustion,<br>
More ozone forms in the summer because there's more ultraviolet radiation hitting the earth from the sun.<br>
Health effect<br>
Ground level Ozone is bad for people who has heart or lung disease.<br>
mortality from ozone pollution is expected to grow.<br>
Ozone isn't just bad for people, it's bad for plants too.<br>
Wildfires and Particulate Matter<br>
The air pollution produced by the fires killed tens of thousands of people.<br>
Smoke is comprised of many toxic substances, includes acrolein (a lung irritant), carbon monoxide (which can be fatal at high concentrations); formaldehyde, benzene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs (all of which can cause cancer); and particulate matter (PM).<br>
PM2.5 causes heart attacks and strokes and a lot of diseases.<br>
Particulate matter around the world<br>
Outdoor PM2.5 comes from combustion of fossil fuels, with coal and diesel fuel, indoor PM mostly comes from burning fuels to cook and heat homes with.<br>
PM 2.5 is primarily in Africa, the middle east and south and east asia.<br>
Allergies and Asthma<br>
Pollen is a major contributor to seasonal allergies and can cause asthma attacks.<br>
higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air are contributing to greater pollen output from ragweed plants.<br>
Urban Heat Islands<br>
Cities and Local Temperatures<br>
Cities are almost always hotter than surrounding areas, because cities are mostly draped in grey asphalt roads and dark roofs.<br>
Heat islands have warmed cities around the world much faster than the effects of climate change.<br>
Urban Greening<br>
Green Spaces and Temperature<br>
Urban green can substantially cool off cities.<br>
people have started to look at roof space, they can confer greater benefits to the building's occupants in terms of the need for heating and cooling.<br>
People who have to pay for energy in buildings will pay less when they have green roofs.<br>
green roofs prevent water runoff into storm sewers.<br>
When sewers overflow, it can set the stage for waterborne disease outbreaks.</p>

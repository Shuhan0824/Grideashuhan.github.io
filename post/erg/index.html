                <p>Renewables in packaging<br>
Renewables as a circular strategy<br>
Renew as a circular strategy<br>
The use of renewable materials can be regarded as a circular strategy because biological nutrients, or materials, can be cycled through continuous loops in the biosphere.<br>
A Few Definitions<br>
Biobased: it is completely or partially derived from biomass.<br>
Renewable: it can be naturally regenerated on a human timescale. This means that the rate of regeneration has to keep up with harvesting and consumption.<br>
Renewable Materials for Packaging<br>
Renewable Materials for Packaging<br>
three main categories of biobased plastics: The first are plastics made directly from polymers from biomass.<br>
The second are plastics made from polymerised monomers (the building blocks of              polymers) extracted from biomass.<br>
The third are plastics made by microorganisms (such as bacteria) from biomass.<br>
The main benefit of biobased materials is that they don’t require non-renewable resources (such as oil) for their production.<br>
Challenges: the risk of deforestation and the safeguarding of labour conditions throughout their production chain.<br>
biomass is a viable alternative for fossil based resources for the plastics industry.<br>
Biodegradability<br>
At their end-of-life, some materials can biodegrade. This happens under specific circumstances: the presence of certain microorganisms, a certain temperature and a certain humidity.<br>
Some materials may biodegrade in all types of environments, while others require very specific industrial (composting) processes. Currently, research is focussed on making biodegradable materials more cost effective.<br>
A challenge when designing biodegradable packaging is making sure it does not biodegrade during its functional life<br>
Biodegradability always has to make sense as a product’s end-of-life strategy: if it is impossible to retrieve waste packaging for recycling or reuse, it may be better if it is biodegradable.<br>
A Few More Definitions<br>
Biodegradability：it can be broken down by living organisms into biomass, water and natural occurring gasses (such as methane and carbon dioxide).<br>
Compostable (at home/ industrial)：Composting is biodegradation in composting conditions. the material is broken down by microorganisms in certain conditions (temperature, humidity, presence of oxygen) in a certain time without negatively influencing the quality of the compost.<br>
Not all biobased plastics are biodegradable.<br>
The Future of Renewable Packaging<br>
Besides plastics, there are other innovative biobased packaging materials. An option for replacing conventional plastics is fibre based materials. The main challenge for developing these materials is recreating the properties of plastics. （they are less resistant to humidity, weigh more and provide a less effective gas barrier. ）<br>
Case study: bio4pack<br>
Bio4Pack's Renewable Packaging<br>
Bio4Pack’s products are not home compostable, so industrial composting is required.<br>
Different types of packaging require different materials. The choice of material largely depends on the properties (such as flexibility/ rigidity) that the packaging application needs to have.<br>
Challenges with Renewables<br>
Bio4Pack is able to provide renewable and compostable alternatives for about 80% of all packaging types.<br>
The limitations that remain depend largely on the barrier properties that the packaging requires, such as vacuum bags and cling film.<br>
Other disadvantages are the maximum shelf life of biobased packaging items and their price compared to conventional alternatives.<br>
Legislation also poses a problem<br>
Bioplastics is not economically viable to do so.</p>
